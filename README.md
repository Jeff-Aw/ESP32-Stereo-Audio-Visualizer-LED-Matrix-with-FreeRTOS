# ESP32-Stereo-Audio-Visualizer-LED-Matrix-with-FreeRTOS
This project is an upgrade from a [previous project](https://www.hackster.io/chef_jeff69/esp32-stereo-audio-spectrum-visualizer-with-amplifier-47bbff) that works on the same Fast Fourier Transform Algorithim. 

The upgrades in this project compared to the previous one:
- 2D LED Matrix
- Bluetooth suport
- High accuracy external ADC (MCP 3002)
- Built in 20W stereo speakers 
- High clarity audio driven by class AB amplifier with ground loop isolator
